this is an open-source project forked from Github. 
And so, you can fork it to match your requirement by changing the library. Because it is shared.

And as we all know, CalendarView is imported into Android platform since Android 3.0(API 11). 
So it is inappropriate for Android R&D Enginner to develop enchanting product. So Android Developers takes brainstorms
